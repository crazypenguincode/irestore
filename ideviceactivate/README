ideviceactivate is a small utility to activate iDevices from the comfort of your GNU/Linux box.

Users not comfortable with using a shell should wait for iDeviceActivator, which provides an easier way to do all this.

===Credits===

Almost all of the code, with the major exception of the caching code, was written by p0sixninja.
The caching code and the documentation was written by boxingsquirrel.

===Building===

Fetch your dependencies. Because these vary from distro to distro, I won't list specific packages here, that said you need developement packages for: libimobiledevice, libplist, usbmuxd, libgthread2, librt, gnutls, libtasn1, libxml2, libglib2, and libcurl.

Then:
	git clone git://github.com/boxingsquirrel/ideviceactivate.git
	cd ideviceactivate
	make
	sudo make install

===Running===

For straight-up activation with nothing fancy: ideviceactivate
For the same, but deactivating: ideviceactivate -x

Now, to run with the caching stuff:

	Create the cache and activate the device:
	ideviceactivate -c <cache directory>

	Use an already created cache to activate the device:
	ideviceactivate -r <cache directory>

Notes:
	The -u flag can be used to target a device by its UUID.
	If you have an activation record lying around, you can specify it along with the -f flag.

	The IMEI, IMSI, ICCID, and SerialNumber can be specified on the command line with the -e, -s, -i, and -n flags respectively.
